    dirpath = os.path.join(USER_CODE_DIR, dirname)
    if os.path.isdir(dirpath): # Option 1: each directory is a mount point
        # How to aggregate tools from multiple files in this dir?
        # Or, does it mean each FILE is a mount point, named after its parent DIR?
        # "each python file in a directory should be routed under the name of the directory"
        # This implies: file `user_code/shopping/cart.py` -> route `/shopping/...` for tools in `cart.py`
        # What if there's also `user_code/shopping/products.py`? Route `/shopping/...` too? Conflict.

        # More likely: `user_code/math_utils/arithmetic.py` -> route `/math_utils/arithmetic/...`
        # Or `user_code/math_utils.py` -> route `/math_utils/...`

        # Let's assume: each file `module_name.py` in `USER_CODE_DIR` becomes a mount point `/module_name`
        pass # Needs clearer routing rule

# Re-interpreting "each python file in a directory should be routed under the name of the directory":
# If user has:
# input_dir/
#   billing/
#     invoices.py
#     payments.py
#   users/
#     profiles.py
#
# Then tools in `invoices.py` are under `/billing/invoices/...` (or just `/billing/...` if `invoices.py` defines the tools for `/billing`)
# Tools in `payments.py` are under `/billing/payments/...`
# Tools in `profiles.py` are under `/users/profiles/...`

# This suggests a recursive scan and flattening the path into the mount point.
# Example: `input_dir/MODA/MODB/file.py` -> mount at `/MODA/MODB/file`

# Let's simplify for now: assume user provides a flat directory of .py files.
# `user_code/math.py` -> `/math/...`
# `user_code/strings.py` -> `/strings/...`

```

Okay, I've reviewed the "A change in direction" notepad and compared it with your previous thoughts in "command-line sdk" and "Module Core."

The new direction provides excellent clarity: the project aims to be a **lightweight wrapper around `uvicorn.run`**, packaging user-provided Python files into a service that's easy to run via a `start.sh` script. This service will use a Starlette application with its multi-mount capabilities to expose functionalities from the user's Python files, where "each python file in a directory should be routed under the name of the directory."

This is a shift from a general "templating" or "command-line SDK" approach towards a more specific goal: packaging a web service (likely FastMCP-based, given the context) from user code.

Here's the plan for the project's next steps:

1.  **Crucial First Step: Design the Dynamic Starlette Application Builder**

    This is the core of the new direction. We need to define how the main Starlette application will be constructed dynamically based on the user's Python files. This involves:

    *   **Defining User Code Input Structure:**
        *   How will users provide their Python files? (e.g., a single root directory).
        *   Example: User provides `./my_project_source/`.

    *   **Interpreting the Routing Rule: "each python file in a directory should be routed under the name of the directory."**
        *   This is key. A clear mapping from the user's file/directory structure to URL routes is needed.
        *   Proposal: If a user provides a source directory (e.g., `user_src/`), and it contains:
            *   `user_src/moduleA.py`
            *   `user_src/subsystemB/moduleC.py`
        *   The tools from `moduleA.py` would be mounted under a route like `/moduleA/...`.
        *   The tools from `moduleC.py` (within `subsystemB/`) would be mounted under `/subsystemB/moduleC/...`.
        *   Each such Python file would likely have its own `FastMCP` instance, whose ASGI app is then mounted by the main Starlette app.

    *   **Tool Discovery and Integration (FastMCP Assumption):**
        *   Are users expected to write Python files with functions already decorated with `@mcp.tool()` (as seen in `advanced.py`)?
        *   Or, should our tool automatically discover suitable plain Python functions and wrap them to become FastMCP tools (as hinted in "Module Core": "read a function's signature and docstring to construct an identical one but with a mcp_tool wrapper")?
        *   This decision will significantly affect the implementation of the dynamic app builder. Assuming pre-decorated tools simplifies the initial build.

    *   **Implementation Sketch for the Dynamic App (`main_app.py` generated by your tool):**
        *   This script (let's call it `main_app.py` within the packaged project) will:
            1.  Scan the packaged user code directory (e.g., `project/user_code/`).
            2.  For each Python file (or logical module based on the directory structure):
                *   Dynamically import the module.
                *   Create a `FastMCP` instance for it.
                *   Discover and add its tools to this `FastMCP` instance.
                *   Get the ASGI app from this `FastMCP` instance (e.g., `mcp.http_app(path="/")`).
                *   Append a `starlette.routing.Mount(route_prefix, app=mcp_asgi_app)` to a list of routes, where `route_prefix` is derived from the file's path as per the routing rule.
            3.  Initialize the main `Starlette(routes=...)` application.
            4.  Handle lifespans correctly if multiple `FastMCP` instances are involved.

2.  **Develop the Packaging Script**

    Once the dynamic Starlette app generation logic (from step 1) is designed, we'll create the script that orchestrates the packaging:
    *   Takes user input: source directory of Python files, output ZIP name, desired host/port for `start.sh`, etc.
    *   Creates a temporary "project" staging directory.
    *   Copies user Python files into a structured location within this "project" directory (e.g., `project/user_code/`).
    *   Generates the `main_app.py` script (containing the logic from step 1) within the "project" directory.
    *   Generates the `start.sh` script. This script will:
        *   Install necessary dependencies (e.g., `uvicorn`, `starlette`, `fastmcp`, any user dependencies if specified). The `src/demo/start.sh` is a good reference.
        *   Include the command to run the service, e.g., `uvicorn main_app:app --host <configured_host> --port <configured_port>`.
    *   Generates a basic `README.md` for the packaged service.
    *   Zips the "project" directory to produce the final distributable.

3.  **Create a CLI for the Packager (Optional, but Recommended)**

    *   To make the packaging tool user-friendly, a Command Line Interface (using Typer, as suggested in "command-line sdk") would be beneficial.
    *   Example: `mcp-packager package ./my_api_files --output my_service.zip --port 8080`

**Immediate Focus:**

Let's start by solidifying the design for **Step 1: The Dynamic Starlette Application Builder.** Specifically, we need to:
    a. Finalize the interpretation of the routing rule: "each python file in a directory should be routed under the name of the directory." My proposal is path-based routing for each file.
    b. Decide on the tool discovery mechanism (pre-decorated vs. auto-wrap).

What are your thoughts on these two points (a and b) for the dynamic app builder? This will pave the way for its implementation.

## Original Thoughts(Important!)

**Lightweight wrapper, not templating**

1. our project should be a lightweight encapsulation around uvicorn.run
2. when a user requests for a packaging, a @start.sh would be provided, it would give the user the environment (i.e. this package) and call run as if we are in command line
- what is different:
2.1 we no longer use templates to generate a file and pack them with the shell script
2.2 we simply include the installation of this package of this package within in the shell script, along with command line to start a service based on the 
2.3 when user uses the package, he executes the script, load this package and run from the command line
2.4 thus there is no need to generate any other file except for the shell script
3. user arguments from commandline when packaging only dedicates how the command lines are in 
4. therefore it is essential to pack the entirety of user python files into the project directory
